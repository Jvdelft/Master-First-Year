# First Year of Master projects
Those are my latest works at the ULB. I will quickly describe each of them and the contents of each file in the following sections.
If you want more information, don't hesitate to contact me through my email: julienvandelft@hotmail.fr

# 7DoF Robot Trajectory Control
The project was focused on computing inverse kinematics for a 7 DoF robot arm (Franka) and implementing it in simulation to check the accuracy of the computations.
The motion had an objective to take a glass of liquid and transport it somewhere else to pour it. 
To get a clear idea of the results, there is a video called 7DoFFrankaSimulation.mp4 showing the results. 
The details of the computations are in the Final Report file.
It is important to note that the robot had not enough strength to pike up the cylinder. It was asked by the professor to let it like that for the simulation.

# Control Design Ball in Tube
It is a project of designing a control law for an unknown system with disturbances. The first phase was an identification process. 
Then, the control law was designed and tested in Matlab and Simulink.
To have more details, please have a look at the final presentation PowerPoint or final report which present the computations and results.

# FEM Wrench
This is a finite elements modelling problem of a wrench with coherent loads and boundary conditions. The theoretical computations were first held in Matlab. 
After that, the software SalomeMeca was used to make the practical finite elements analysis. The details of computations and results are in the FEM Wrench Report.

# IoT Enabled Exoskeleton
My Master 1 project was focused on enabling an exoskeleton to be connected to the internet through cellular connectivity for remote and real-time monitoring and control.
It was divided into several parts. The first was the coding and designing of the electronic circuit using an Arduino, sensors and cellular connectivity modules.
Another one was the construction of real-time servers on a Rasberry Pi for receiving and sending messages to the exoskeleton. 
Finally, an interface was needed to send and read the messages on a computer remotely. The three parts were built and assembled. 
To see the results, please have a look at the report and presentation (the latter has several videos of the results).
There is also a YouTube video showing the connectivity between the Arduino, the servers and the computer/phone. 
The Arduino was also processing the messages and interpreting them to turn on/off LEDs. The link is the following: https://youtu.be/ZdoZL-N9F24

# Real Time Electronics Coding
The coding of real-time systems is usually not an easy task. This project had for objective to code a real-time system in the form of a contamination game. 
The computing time needed to be optimized in order to be able to vaccinate everyone before they died. There were several things to deal with in the most adequated order possible to save time.
More precise explanations are in the final report.

# Soft Gripper Robot
The last project is a dual project. The first part was a theoretical design part. This included considering the fabrication processes, time, costs and so on. For this part, a 3DoF robot was considered.
The other part was practical mechanical construction. This consisted of constructing the actual robot, coding and designing the electronics and getting physical results.
The theoretical part is in the Design folder. Meanwhile, the practical part is in the CAD and Code folders. 
To grasp more details about it, please have look at the report and presentation. 
There is also an instructable on the practical construction, in which a presentation video is shown. The following link is the instructable: https://www.instructables.com/Fruit-Sorter-Robot-Using-Flexible-Gripper/
